# The Web API
- Throughout previous chapters, we **learned** how to use **some of the backend components** so that **storeowners** can **manage and manipulate** the **data** such as **customers**, **products**, **categories**, **orders** and so on.
- Sometimes this is not enough, like when we are **pulling data in or out** from **third-party systems**. In cases like these, the **Magento Web API framework** makes it **easy to call Magento services** through **REST** or **SOAP**.
